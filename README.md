# Private-Construction-Spending-Forecast

# General Overview
In this project, I forecast total private construction spending on manufacturing in CA using 30 years of data from FRED. You will find instructions for this project in "Project_2_Questions.pdf" and the code/write-up in an R Markdown file named "Project_2_Answers.Rmd".

# Use Case
This project provides an example of how to fit a forecasting model with trend, season dummies and cycles. In addition, this project showcases the use of vector autoregressive (VAR) modeling, which is a multivariate time series model that relates current observations of a variable with past observations of itself and past observations of other variables in the system.

# Important Notes
1. As noted in the assignment instructions, in order for the forecasting model to adequately capture the cyclical dynamics, you will need a large time horizon within the selected data. Therefore, if you are looking to replicate this work with a different data set, it is suggested that you have at least 10 years of observations.
2. In order to fit a VAR model, you will need at least two time-series variables.
3. All supporting data that is used in my script can be found in the "Supporting_Data" folder, should you be looking to replicate this exact work.
